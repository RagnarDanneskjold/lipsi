## Take notes on hours spent on Chisel coding

Mo 23.10.2017 2h30 on the train to Linkoping, first minimal architecture
Tu 31.10.2017 3h15 at DTU, immediate instructions, start with assembler
We  1.11.2017 2h30 at home, testing organized, assembler immediate instructions,
                      register ALU operations
We  8.11.2017 1h00 at home, indirect load and store (assembler, implementation, test)
Th  9.11.2017 1h45 at DTU, SW simulator (ALU operations plus st) and co-simulation
Mo 13.11.2017 0h15 at DTU, indirect load and store in the SW simulator
Tu 14.11.2017 1h00 at DTU, branch
              1h15 at DTU, IO and blinking/counting LEDS

Implementation basically finished in 13h30.

              ca. 1 hour to implement a Lipsi manycore
